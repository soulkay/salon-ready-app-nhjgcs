This will involve adding UI elements for selecting services, dates, and times. Since there is already a modal demo, we can adapt that to show the booking screen.\n    *   The booking screen should display available time slots.\n    *   Implement logic to handle booking requests. Since we are not using Supabase, this will be mocked data.\n2.  **Create a Queue Status Screen:**\n    *   Create a new file `app/(tabs)/queue.tsx` to display the user's queue number and estimated waiting time.\n    *   This screen should fetch and display the user's current queue status.\n    *   Implement a mechanism to update the queue status in real-time (e.g., using `setInterval` to simulate updates).\n3.  **Implement Alert System:**\n    *   Use `expo-notifications` to send local notifications to users when their turn is approaching.\n    *   Schedule notifications based on the estimated waiting time.\n4.  **Modify Tab Layout:**\n    *   Update `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include the new \"Queue\" tab.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan.\n\n**Instructions for the coding agent:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Adapt the existing modal demo to create a booking screen.\n    *   Add UI elements for selecting services, dates, and times.\n    *   Implement logic to handle booking requests (mock data).\n2.  **Create `app/(tabs)/queue.tsx`:**\n    *   Create a new file `app/(tabs)/queue.tsx`.\n    *   Implement a screen to display the user's queue number and estimated waiting time.\n    *   Fetch and display the user's current queue status (mock data).\n    *   Implement a mechanism to update the queue status in real-time (e.g., using `setInterval` to simulate updates).\n3.  **Implement Alert System:**\n    *   Install `expo-notifications`.\n    *   Use `expo-notifications` to send local notifications to users when their turn is approaching.\n    *   Schedule notifications based on the estimated waiting time.\n4.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Update `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include the new \"Queue\" tab, using the IconSymbol component.\n5.  Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T18:42:51.515070"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching for relevant information to help build this hair salon booking app."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current files to understand the structure better:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I'll install the necessary dependencies and create the hair salon booking app with all the requested features:"}, {"type": "dependency_management", "action": "install", "dependencies": ["expo-notifications", "@react-native-community/datetimepicker"], "status": "complete", "success": true, "stdout": "Progress: resolved 1, reused 0, downloaded 0, added 0\n\u2009WARN\u2009 deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from@7.18.9: This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained.

I've created a complete hair salon booking app with all the requested features. Here's what I've implemented:\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 **Features Implemented:**\n\n### 1. **Home Screen (Booking)**\n- Beautiful hero section with salon branding\n- List of all available services with prices and durations\n- \"Book Appointment\" button that opens a modal\n- Booking modal with:\n  - Customer name input\n  - Service selection\n  - Date picker\n  - Time slot selection (with available/unavailable states)\n  - Confirmation button\n- Opening hours and location information cards\n\n### 2. **Queue Status Screen**\n- Real-time queue tracking showing:\n  - Current queue number being served\n  - User's queue number\n  - Number of people ahead\n  - Estimated wait time\n- Animated pulsing effect when it's almost your turn\n- Progress bar showing queue completion percentage\n- Info cards with helpful tips\n- Cancel booking option\n- Simulated queue progression (updates every 10 seconds for demo)\n\n### 3. **Profile Screen**\n- User profile with avatar\n- Statistics (appointments count, rating)\n- Contact information\n- Preferences (notifications, favorite service)\n- Action buttons (booking history, settings)\n- Loyalty rewards card with progress bar\n\n### 4. **Notification System**\n- Integrated `expo-notifications`\n- Automatic permission requests\n- Scheduled notifications when it's almost your turn (5 minutes before)\n- Immediate notifications when it's your turn\n- Android notification channel setup\n- Notification cancellation on booking cancel\n\n### 5. **Design & Colors**\n- Implemented the exact color scheme you specified:\n  - Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White)\n  - Text: `#282828` (Dark Gray)\n  - Primary: `#FF69B4` (Hot Pink)\n  - Secondary: `#BA55D3` (Medium Orchid)\n  - Accent: `#20B2AA` (Light Sea Green)\n  - And more...\n- Modern, clean UI with smooth animations\n- Proper spacing and shadows\n- Responsive design for different screen sizes\n\n### 6. **Navigation**\n- Three-tab layout: Home, Queue, Profile\n- Custom floating tab bar for Android/Web\n- Native tabs for iOS\n- Smooth transitions\n\n## \ud83d\udcf1 **How It Works:**\n\n1. **Book an Appointment**: Users enter their name, select a service, choose a date and time slot, then confirm\n2. **Get Queue Number**: Upon booking, users receive a queue number and estimated wait time\n3. **Track Progress**: The Queue screen shows real-time updates of the current queue and their position\n4. **Receive Alerts**: Users get notifications when it's almost their turn and when it's their turn\n5. **Manage Profile**: View stats, preferences, and loyalty rewards\n\nThe app uses mock data for demonstration purposes, so it works without a backend. The queue progresses automatically every 10 seconds to show the functionality. All notifications are local notifications that work on both iOS and Android!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-19T18:42:39Z"}]
